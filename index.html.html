                        <u><h2>About me</h2></u>
                        <p>I am Altamash Chandiwala a graduate in Bachelors in Information Technology from St. Andrew's College of Arts, Science & Commerce with a decent score of 8.92 CGPA, I am a Full Stack Web Developer and Software Engineering. My journey in Information Technology was very uneven I had to idea what programming was. I was interested in gaming at that time also opened a youtube channel of mine. I wanted a Laptop to better for that I had taken this course so that my mother could buy me a high end pc but unfortunately COVID became epidemic and everyone was working from home so most of the time it was with mother as she is a teacher by profession. I was one of those children who had no idea what to do in life. Until and unless when I started making my final year project, I realized that I love programming earlier for studies I have to be forced to do it but for programming I was doing it all by myself. During the my course I was introduced to various programming languages like C,C++,C#,HTML & CSS,Python,etc.</p>
